photo-storage:
  # The base URL for the Photo Storage Service API.
  # When running locally (outside Docker Compose), use localhost and the port of photo-storage-service.
  # The photo-storage-service is configured to run on port 8082.
  service-url: http://localhost:8082

  # When running within Docker Compose, the hostname will be the name of the service
  # as defined in docker-compose.yml (e.g., 'photo-storage-service').
  # You'd typically use profiles (e.g., dev, prod, docker) to switch this URL.
  # For now, keep localhost for local testing. We'll adjust for Docker Compose later.
